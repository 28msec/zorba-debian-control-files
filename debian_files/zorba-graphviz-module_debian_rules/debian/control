Description: a general purpose XQuery processor
 Module that provides functions for generating SVG graphs.
 .
 The module provides two function for generating graphs given in the :
 .
 * DOT language (see http://www.graphviz.org)
 * or in the XML-based Graph eXchange Language 
 (see http://www.gupro.de/GXL/), respectively.
 .
 Both functions use the Graphviz Visualization Library in order to layout and
 render the graphs. As a result, both return a sequence of (document)-nodes
 (one for each input graph). These nodes are instances of the Scalable Vector
 Graphics (SVG) format. SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional
 graphics and graphical applications in XML. More information about SVG can be
 found at http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/. As second parameters, both functions
 take a sequence of strings that are parameters for the graph generation and
 rendering algorithms. Currently, only the empty-sequence is allowed here.
 These parameters exist for future use.
