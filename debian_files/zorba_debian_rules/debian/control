Description: a general purpose XQuery processor
 Zorba is a general purpose XQuery processor implementing in C++ the W3C family
 of specifications. It is not an XML database. The query processor has been
 designed to be embeddable in a variety of environments such as other
 programming languages extended with XML processing capabilities, browsers,
 database servers, XML message dispatchers, or smartphones. Its architecture
 employes a modular design, which allows customizing the Zorba query processor
 to the environmentâ€™s needs. In particular the architecture of the query
 processor allows a pluggable XML store (e.g. main memory, DOM stores,
 persistent disk-based large stores, S3 stores). Zorba runs on most platforms
 and is available under the Apache license v2.
